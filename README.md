# Form
Java Servlet Form Submission – Reference Project
📌 Description

This repository contains a basic Java Servlet form submission example deployed on Apache Tomcat.

⚠️ Important Note:
This code was sourced from an online tutorial/example. I did not originally write this implementation.

I uploaded this project as a personal reference because:

Some online examples were not working in my environment

This version works correctly

I want a stable reference for future learning

I plan to modify and experiment with it

🎯 Purpose

This repository is for:

Study purposes

Testing servlet deployment

Understanding form request handling

Future modification and experimentation
